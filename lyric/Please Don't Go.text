Nobody ever knows
Nobody ever sees
I left my soul
Back then, no I'm too weak
Most nights I pray for you to come home
Praying to the lord
Praying for my soul
Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go
'Cause I don't ever wanna know
Don't ever want to see things change
'Cause when I'm living on my own
I wanna take it back and start again
Most nights I pray for you to come home
I'm praying to the lord
I'm praying for my soul
Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep
When I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go
I sent so many messages
You don't reply
Gotta feel around, what am I missing babe?
Singing now, oh oh oh
I need you now, I need your love, oh
Now please don't go
I said most nights I hardly sleep
When I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go
So please don't go
So please don't go
So please don't go
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go
