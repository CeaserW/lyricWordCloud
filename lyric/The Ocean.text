You can be my guiding light
Keep me
Company in the night
That's all I need
All I want
Is for you to stay a little longer now
With arms around me
Like a border
Like the air I breathe
I let you in
Keep me warm underneath my skin
Cause I'm
Giving in
To your touch
I can never get enough
Dive in deep
Into the ocean
Ocean
Ocean
You can be my safety zone
Somewhere
I can go and feel unknown
Now I'm
Giving in to your touch
I will never get enough
Dive in deep into the ocean
Ocean
Ocean
